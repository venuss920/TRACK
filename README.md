# TRACK, ONGOING/VOLUNTARY BASED PROJECT AND LEARNING.

This Project covers the widespan of steps as follows:

1. The Project is based on the Behavioral cloning, generating the datas from the Udacity-Self driving Car Simulator(Open Source)
2. Analysis of the csv file using pandas library, with the particular feauture selection. - Steering angle.
3. Image Preprocessing - a. image pixels's normalisation.
4. Training and Validation Split of the data.
5. Utilisation of the Data Augmentation Techniques to generate more training dataset, so that over model predicts with a better accuracy and drops out the problem of overfitting.
6. And Furthermore
